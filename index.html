      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        In the majority of cases, businesses already implement some known revocation 
        approaches.
        <br>
        <br>
        One of these "known" options is the usage of directory services such 
        as Active Directory that provides the access to records via 
        <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol'>Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP)<a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        An <a>issuer</a> of <a>verifiable credentials</a> in such a system
        [[VC-DATA-MODEL]] can use a pointer to a particular location at 
        <a>directory service</a> inside of <a>verifiable credential</a>, that 
        a <a>verifier</a> can check to see if a credential has been revoked.

    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h2>Process Flow</h2>

        Here we describe the assumptions in this usage of an underlying <a>directory 
        service</a>, which leverages <a>LDAP</a> to obtain records of revocation 
        status for a given <a>verifiable credential</a>.
        <br>
        <br>
        First of all, entire <a>verifiable credentials</a> issued by an <a>issuer</a> 
        are not assumed to be recorded in <a>directory service</a> by default.
        Some subset of information, however, need to be retained for revocation to be 
        executed later, i.e. the pointer to where a revocation record will be posted 
        if that credential is revoked later. This record can contain more or less 
        information, but it is assumed this record at least exist to claim credential 
        status as revoked.
        <br>
        <br>
        In the case of a given credential's revocation, a respective record becomes 
        publicly accessible and a data of this record can be returned via an LDAP URL that 
        can be be securely and deterministically constructed via the following list of 
        properties of a verifiable credential:
        <ul>
          <li><a>credentialStatus.ssl</a></li>
          <li><a>credentialStatus.host</a></li>
          <li><a>credentialStatus.query</a></li>
          <li><a>credentialStatus.params</a></li>
        </ul>
        If a record is returned by the query assembled from these variables, thereafter, 
        this verifiable credential should be considered as revoked and any additional 
        information will be included in the returned message.

      <section>
        <h3>RevocationStatus2021LDAP</h3>

        <p>
          When an <a>issuer</a> desires to enable revocation for a
          <a>verifiable credential</a>, they MAY add a <code>status</code> 
          property that uses the data model described in this specification.

        credential</a> that includes <a>RevocationStatus2021LDAP</a> method as

          Define parts of LDAP URL to a resource at <a>directory service</a>

        <li>

          property.
        </li>

          The value of the <a>date</a> property MUST be ISO string or UNIX

    <h2>Privacy Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      This section details the general privacy considerations and specific privacy
      implications of deploying this specification into production environments.
    </p>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Correlation</h3>

      <p>
        This method is best suited for fully public or semi-public credentials. 
        Referencing the <a>verifiable credential</a>'s unique ID in the LDAP query string 
        adds additional correlation risk, which may be an anti-pattern in some use 
        cases.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="informative">
      <h3>Content Distribution Networks</h3>

      <p>
        The use of content distribution networks by <a>issuers</a> can increase the
        privacy of <a>holders</a> by reducing or eliminating requests for the
        revocation lists from the <a>issuer</a>. Often, a request for a revocation
        list will be served by an edge device and thus be faster and reduce the load
        on the server as well as cloaking <a>verifier</a> and <a>holder</a>
        traffic from <a>issuers</a>.

    <h2>Security Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of security considerations that implementers should be
      aware of when processing data described by this specification. Ignoring or
      not understanding the implications of this section can result in
      security vulnerabilities.
    </p>

    <p>
      While this section attempts to highlight a broad set of security
      considerations, it is not a complete list. Implementers are urged to seek the
      advice of security and cryptography professionals when implementing mission
      critical systems using the technology outlined in this specification.

    <h2>Accessibility Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of accessibility considerations implementers should be
      aware of when processing data described in this specification. As with any web
      standards or protocols implementation, ignoring accessibility issues makes
      this information unusable to a large subset of the population. It is important
      to follow accessibility guidelines and standards, such as [[WCAG21]], to ensure
      all people, regardless of ability, can make use of this data. This is
      especially important when establishing systems utilizing cryptography, which
      have historically created problems for assistive technologies.

    <p>
      This section details the general accessibility considerations to take into
      account when utilizing this data model.

    <h2>Internationalization Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      There are a number of internationalization considerations implementers should be
      aware of when publishing data described in this specification. As with any web
      standards or protocols implementation, ignoring internationalization makes it
      difficult for data to be produced and consumed across a disparate set of
      languages and societies, which would limit the applicability of the
      specification and significantly diminish its value as a standard.
    </p>

    <p>
      This section outlines general internationalization considerations to take into
      account when utilizing this data model.
